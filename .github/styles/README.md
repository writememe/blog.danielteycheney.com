# Local Development

If developing locally, you need download the latest ZIP files and put into this folder:

```
https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/releases/latest/download/Microsoft.zip
https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good/releases/latest/download/write-good.zip
```

You should end up with something like:

```bash
styles/
    Microsoft/
        <contents of zip file>
    write-good/
        <contents of zip file>
```
