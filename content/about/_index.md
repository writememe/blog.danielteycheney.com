### About ###

Iâ€™m Daniel and I live in Ocean Grove, Australia. When I'm at work, I'm mostly involved in networking, automation, security and consulting. I'm always trying to find ways of being more accurate and efficient or helping others with the same endeavours.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending my time with my two children and supporting my partner in her career pursuits. 

I enjoy cycling and any chance I can, I'll be out riding and enjoying being outside. I'm also a Carlton football club tragic, although one could argue that there's little enjoyment being one for the last 15 years.

Whether I'm working or not, I try to live life with a value-driven approach and associate myself to people of similar values.
