# Why I started this blog #

I've found myself reading many people's blogs of who I respect. I use blogs all the time to learn something or get myself out of a problem. Whilst this is beneficial for me, it's not giving back to the wider community. So I plan to share some posts on things which I think could be valuable to others.

I find a lot of networking blogs which are great for how to great WidgetX or WidgetY to work, the technical side. There isn't much out there which talk about the non-technical side as well and it's how all combined.I will aim to blog about technical and non-technical subjects in equal measure.
